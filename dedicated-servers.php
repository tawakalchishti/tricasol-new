                                    <p>Dedicated Server Hosting is a web hosting in which you are letting a physical

                                        the speed your site require. A Dedicated Server is much faster than shared
                                        hosting because it is completely isolated from one another and you are not
                                        sharing resources such as storage or bandwidth with other sites so, users get
                                        full access to configure their server anyway. If you want to complete control,
                                        flexibility and security, you need Dedicated Server Hosting because there is no
