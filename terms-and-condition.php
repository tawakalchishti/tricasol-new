					<h2>Premium Domain Registries</h2>
				<p>If a name you’re looking for happens to be premium, the search results will indicate as much, and show the actual price for the domain name.</p>
        <p>Registry-sold premium domains may be of two types –</p>
        <p>Some domains may be sold at a very high initial price but will renew or transfer at the same price as a regular domain name.
Other domains may be sold at a higher price, but will also renew or transfer at the same higher price.</p>
<p>However, you understand that the Company does not control all aspects of the domain registration process. For example, once you submit a domain registration, the Company forwards the information contained in the registration to the appropriate Registry Administrator for processing and actual registration of the name.</p>
     <p>Also, as consideration for the domain registration service provided by the company, you agree to pay the company, prior to the effectiveness of the desired domain registration. Keeping in mind, once the company confirms the payment and starts registration process, ICAAN holds the authority to put the amendments at any stage of order processing, therefore the company will not be held liable for any inaccuracies.</p>
