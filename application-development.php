          <strong class="mb-15 d-block">Native apps</strong>
          <p class="mb-15">Native apps are particularly designed for any specific platform or device. Every app is operating system specific, we can say that we can’t use iOS app on any other operating system such as Android. So we need to design apps for such system specifically and separately.</p>
          <p class="mb-15">Native apps provide with improved and diverse faculties which no other app can provide. Every native app is present at their respective platforms i.e. iOS app is available on apple store and android app on google play store. Native apps always reach to the person of interest through app stores.</p>
          <p class="mb-15">Native apps are expensive than other apps because of the fact native application is develope separately for each operating system. They not only require discrete support but also maintenance for various other types of apps, consequently, more expensive than usual apps.</p>
          <div class="ts-list">
            <ul>
              <li class="icon"><b>Development Cost: </b>Developmental cost is usually higher because app is developed separately for different operating systems.</li>
              <li class="icon"><b>Performance: </b>Native coding has admittance to device features, while essential components like content and structure are warehoused in it.</li>
              <li class="icon"><b>Device features: </b>Native platform coding has admittance to any device’s API. We have teams that are expert in any kind of development.</li>
              <li class="icon"><b>Maintenance & Upgrade: </b>Maintenance of app will be higher as per demands of any operating system.</li>
              <li class="icon"><b>Code Possibility: </b>Coding for one platform is not usually same for other operating systems.</li>

          <p class="mb-15">As name suggests hybrid apps are develope for multiple platform web technologies such as HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Supposed hybrid apps are actually website applications veiled in a native veil. Hybrid apps are disguis native apps. Web mobile applications and native apps have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
          <p class="mb-15">Hybrid apps are design on single code base for all platforms so designing and architecting such apps is fast and easy-to-develop, low cost maintenance and even updates. Gyroscope, Geo-location and accelerometer are obtainable that are widely preferred APIs.</p>
          <p class="mb-15">Cons of hybrid applications are they are not only drab in performance but also overall working speed is quite slow as compared to the NATIVE APPS. Making a particular app to look same on all operating system is impossible so there is always an architecture issue.</p>

          <p class="mb-15">Web Apps are analogous to Native applications. Web apps use a browser to operate and code is mostly written in HTML5, JavaScript or CSS. These apps are access with URL that is only save as a bookmark in a page.</p>
          <p class="mb-15">These apps need minimal storage to save the URLs. Access to URL is pivot if user wants to acquire admittance to personal record saved on a server, provided if internet connection is available. Poor internet connection results in poor web surfing generally causing a bad user feedback.</p>

              <li class="icon"><b>Code Portability: </b>Single code is used for development.</li>
