              <strong class="mb-15 d-block">WHY DO YOU NEED TO RENEW YOUR DOMAIN NAMES?</strong>
              <p class="mb-15">Many times you have to renew domain names simply because you only purchase a registration for one year or two years at a time. This is because you want to try out the domain name and see if you can make money from it or if it is going to work best for your project or not. This means that after the original period of registration is up you will need to renew your domain names.</p>
              <p class="mb-15">When you have a website, a blog, or both you will need to renew your domain names every single time they expire. You typically will get a 90 day notice, a 30 day notice, and a 15 day notice. It might be a bit more expensive to renew than it was when you first purchased the domain name, but it has to be renewed if you want to continue to use the domain for your website or blog.</p>

              <strong class="mb-15 d-block">Find a Coupon</strong>
              <p class="mb-15">Sometimes when you renew your domain names you can find a coupon code and you will be able to save some money when you renew your domain names. This means that you can save a percentage or sometimes it is a flat renewal fee coupon code that you can use. When you can save money like this you may want to renew your domains for more than just one year.</p>
              <p class="mb-15">Make sure you know when your domains are coming up for renewal and you look for coupon codes that will work for you when they come up for renewal. When you get your 90 day notice telling you that you need to renew it is time to start looking for coupons. You can use the 90 days you have to find the right coupon for you and save money on your domain renewals.</p>

              <strong class="mb-15 d-block">Renew On Time</strong>
              <p class="mb-15">If you wait too long to renew your domain names you will end up having to pay more money to get them back. This can get very expensive and you really have to know that when you do this you will not be able to use a coupon code and you will end up paying nearly twice as much to renew your domains. This is not a good way to go about getting your domains.</p>
              <p class="mb-15">Plus when you wait too long others have the chance to purchase your domains as well. If this happens you cannot get them back until their registration period is up. You will also have to count on them not renewing them and this means that you pretty much have lost the domain you have worked so hard to establish.</p>

              <strong class="mb-15 d-block">Renew for More than 1 Year</strong>
              <p class="mb-15">When you have a domain name that you want to renew you should always renew it for more than one year. This will save you more money and you will have less to worry about as well.</p>
              <p class="mb-15">If you have had the domain for at least a year and you have done well with it, then it is only going to get better.</p>
              <p class="mb-15">In addition to being more convenient, the longer you have it the more love it will get from the search engines because of its’ age, since domain age is now factored into search engine rankings.</p>

          <strong class="mb-15 d-block">A FEW FINAL THINGS TO KNOW WHEN YOU NEED TO RENEW YOUR DOMAIN NAMES</strong>
          <p class="mb-15">Even if you do not want to keep your domain name you should still renew it. Chances are you can sell it for more than what you will pay to renew it and that means you still have an asset that you can leverage. You can use a few different types of sites to help you sell the domain you have, especially if you have a website on it that you can sell with the domain.</p>
          <p class="mb-15">Then, you can include the renewal of the domain name in the package. You can tell the potential buyer that they will not have to renew the domain until a certain date, which is the date it expires. You can charge to have the domain transferred to their hosting account or you can sell them the hosting account you have with the domain name as well.</p>
          <p class="mb-15">This is an asset you can use to make money to expand another domain you own or to use for anything you want to use it for. It would be like leveraging a business building you own that you have not fully developed or that has not produced the income you were hoping it would. This is another reason you want to renew your domain names.</p>
