              <p>Once the Registry System has been updated, the information in our database is shared with the Internet’s zone files worldwide.
This sharing process is called ‘propagation’, because the new information about your Domain Name spreads or propagates across
the Internet. The zone files are propagated frequently, every few hours. We cannot control the rate at which the millions of
servers on the Internet are updated, but generally your domain should be available to Internet users within a very short period.</p>
