          <p class="mb-15">Website security is any action or application taken to ensure website data is not exposed to cybercriminals or to prevent exploitation of websites in any way. Website security is critical component to protect and secure websites and servers. Websites are scanned for any possible vulnerabilities and malware through website security software. This software can scan for backdoor hacks, redirect hacks, Trojans, and many other threats. A website security software notifies the user if the website has any issue and provides solutions to address them.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8"> 
        
        <h4>SSL Certificate:</h4>
          <p class="mb-15">SSL certificates protect the data collected by your website, like emails and credit card numbers, as it is transferred from your site to a server. This is a basic website security measure, but it’s so important that popular browsers and search engines are now labeling sites without SSL as “insecure,” which could make visitors suspicious of your site. Depending on your site, you may be able to get an SSL certificate for free, but be sure to choose the SSL certificate that’s best for your site. Remember that SSL only protects data in transit, so you’ll need to take further steps for a fully secure website.</p>

            <p class="pb-25">A cyberattack costs more the longer it takes to be found, so time is of the essence when a site experiences an attack. A website scanner looks for malware, vulnerabilities and other security issues so that you can mitigate them appropriately. SiteLock’s scanners not only remove known malware, they also look for threats on a daily basis and let you know the moment anything is found, reducing the amount of damage it can do to your site.</p>

            <p class="pb-25">  Websites hosted on a content management system (CMS) are at a higher risk of compromise due to vulnerabilities and security issues often found in third-party plugins and applications. These can be prevented by installing updates to plugins and core software in a timely manner, as these updates often contain security patches – you can even use an <strong>automatic patching solution </strong>to make it easier.</p>
             <p class="pb-25"> Fortunately, there’s a fast and simple way to get what you need to protect your website.<strong> SiteLock </strong>makes website security easy and affordable with automated solutions that are easy to install and plans that work for your budget.
