                    <p class="mb-15">SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an
                        organization’s details. When installed on a web server, it activates the padlock and the https
                        protocol and allows secure connections from a web server to a browser. Typically, SSL is used to
                        secure credit card transactions, data transfer and logins, and more recently is becoming the
                        norm when securing browsing of social media sites.
                        SSL Certificates bind together:
                        A domain name, server name or hostname
                        An organizational identity (i.e. company name) and location.</p>

                    <p class="mb-15">An organization needs to install the SSL Certificate onto its web server to
                        initiate a secure session with browsers. Once a secure connection is established, all web
                        traffic between the web server and the web browser will be secure.
                        </br>
                        When a certificate is successfully installed on your server, the application protocol (also
                        known as HTTP) will change to HTTPs, where the ‘S’ stands for ‘secure’. Depending on the type of
                        certificate you purchase and what browser you are surfing the internet on, a browser will show a
                        padlock or green bar in the browser when you visit a website that has an SSL Certificate
                        installed.</p>

                    <h5>SSL CERTIFICATES USE SOMETHING CALLED PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY.</h5>
                    <p class="mb-15">This particular kind of cryptography harnesses the power of two keys which are long
                        strings of randomly generated numbers. One is called a private key and one is called a public
                        key.A public key is known to your server and available in the public domain. It can be used to
                        encrypt any message. If Alice is sending a message to Bob she will lock it with Bob’s public key
                        but the only way it can be decrypted is to unlock it with Bob’s private key. Bob is the only one
                        who has his private key so Bob is the only one who can use this to unlock Alice’s message. If a
                        hacker intercepts the message before Bob unlocks it, all they will get is a cryptographic code
                        that they cannot break, even with the power of a computer.

                        If we look at this in terms of a website, the communication is happening between a website and a
                        server. Your website and server are Alice and Bob.</p>

                        <h4>WHAT IS AN SSL CERTIFICATE AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</h4>

                        <p class="pb-25">One of the most important components of online business is creating a trusted
                            environment where potential customers feel confident in making purchases. SSL certificates
                            create a foundation of trust by establishing a secure connection. To ensure visitors their
                            connection is secure, browsers provide visual cues, such as a lock icon or a green bar.

                            SSL certificates have a key pair: a public and a private key. These keys work together to
                            establish an encrypted connection. The certificate also contains what is called the
                            “subject,” which is the identity of the certificate/website owner.

                            To get a certificate, you must create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on your server.
                            This process creates a private key and public key on your server. The CSR data file that you
                            send to the SSL Certificate issuer (called a Certificate Authority or CA) contains the
                            public key. The CA uses the CSR data file to create a data structure to match your private
                            key without compromising the key itself. The CA never sees the private key.

                            Once you receive the SSL certificate, you install it on your server. You also install an
                            intermediate certificate that establishes the credibility of your SSL Certificate by tying
                            it to your CA’s root certificate. The instructions for installing and testing your
                            certificate will be different depending on your server.

                            In the image below, you can see what is called the certificate chain. It connects your
                            server certificate to your CA’s (in this case DigiCert’s) root certificate through an
                            intermediate certificate.

                        <h4>How Does the SSL Certificate Create a secure Connection?</h4>

                        <p class="pb-25">When a browser attempts to access a website that is secured by SSL, the browser
                            and the web server establish an SSL connection using a process called an “SSL Handshake”
                            (see diagram below). Note that the SSL Handshake is invisible to the user and happens
                            instantaneously.

                            Essentially, three keys are used to set up the SSL connection: the public, private, and
                            session keys. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private
                            key, and vice versa.

                            Because encrypting and decrypting with private and public key takes a lot of processing
                            power, they are only used during the SSL Handshake to create a symmetric session key. After
                            the secure connection is made, the session key is used to encrypt all transmitted data.
